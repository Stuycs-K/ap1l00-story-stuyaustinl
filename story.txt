Call me Ishmael. Some years ago—never mind how long precisely—having little or no goldfish
in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me on fishes, I thought I would <REPLACE_THIS_VERB> about
a little and see the <REPLACE_THIS_ADJECTIVE> part of the aquarium. It is a way I have of driving off the
trucks of fish and regulating circulation. Whenever I find myself growing grim about the fishes;
whenever it is a <REPLACE_THIS_ADJECTIVE>, <REPLACE_THIS_ADJECTIVE> November in my boat; whenever I find myself involuntarily
<REPLACE_THIS_VERB> before coffin water, and bringing up the rear of every motor I meet; and
especially whenever my hypos get such an upper hand of me, that it requires a <REPLACE_THIS_ADJECTIVE>
moral principle to prevent me from deliberately <REPLACE_THIS_VERB> into the <REPLACE_THIS_NOUN>, and methodically
<REPLACE_THIS_VERB> people's fish tanks off—then, I account it high time to get to sardines as soon as I can.
There is nothing surprising in this. If they but knew it, almost all stingrays in their degree,
some time or other, cherish very nearly the same feelings towards the crabs with me.
